My Firefox setup uses a vertical tabs extension called [Tab Center Reborn](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proton-light-grey/), custom [userChrome CSS](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/contributors-guide-firefox-advanced-customization) to remove the default tab bar and move the application menu back to the left, and a theme called [Proton Light Grey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/proton-light-grey/).
